# usePopcorn App

## Introduction

Welcome to the `usePopcorn` app! This project is inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's work and serves as a practical way to learn and practice ReactJS. With `usePopcorn`, you can easily search for movies, view detailed information, rate them, and track the movies you've watched. Our app leverages an external API for movie data and poster lookups, and utilizes local storage to remember your viewed and rated movies.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Utilize the external movie database API to search for your favorite films.
- **View Movie Details**: Each search result provides detailed information about the movies, including posters.
- **Rate Movies**: Give your personal rating to the movies you've watched.
- **Tracking**: Keep a record of the movies you've watched and see an average rating based on your inputs.
- **Local Storage**: Your watched movies and ratings are saved in your browser, so you can come back to them anytime.
